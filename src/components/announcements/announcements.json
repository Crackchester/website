The next workshop will happen on Thursday at 4pm in Atlas 1, Kilburn Building. We'll be covering how hackers use social techniques to gain access to systems without huge use of software/tools, and instead get information like passwords by pretending to be someone they're not (or some other social technique). This can be person-person communication, or setting up fake man in the middle style attacks. Naturally, we're looking at how we can defend ourselves against these attacks, by spotting them and putting measures in place so these cannot happen."
