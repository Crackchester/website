        "details": "Hi all!!  Weekly workshops are back every Thursday, starting on the 2nd March at 4pm in Atlas 1.  We'll be starting the year off with a series on social engineering, moving away from the HTB based workshops in favour of more interactive, world-based topics.  Next week's focus will be on how hackers gain information from conversations, and how they use other social techniques to gain access to systems.  The key idea will be that even the tightest systems from a code point of view, can be exceptionally vulnerable from a social stand point."
